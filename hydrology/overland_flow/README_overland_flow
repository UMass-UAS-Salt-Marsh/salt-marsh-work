This script follows the guidelines written out in "Flow Modeling in R". The 
filepath to these guidelines are "~/Research Plan/Flow Modeling Workflow". 

This script contains script for filling in the sinks in a chosen dem and burning
in a channel into a raster. I specifically focused on creating and burning a channel
for a culvert found in Red River site. 

Comments are made on each line to help explain what the line means. 



Data location:

Filepath to dem(desire dtms for this analysis):
"~SaltMUAS_share/Data_AllSites/Original Raster/UAS LiDAR DTM"

Within this folder contains different folders for each site. Choose a .tif file
found within a folder to read it into R.

Only overland flow analysis has been made for Red River. So a lot of shapefiles
needed for this analysis are already made so you can pull those files this 
filepath "~UAS Data Collection/Red River/RR_Analysis/Hydrology".

For other sites, you will have to make the stream networks and boundary shapefiles
to be used. Boundaries can be found in "SaltMUAS_share/Data_AllSites/Original Vector/Site Footprint", 
you can also make this in QGIS as well if you don't trust the masks in that folder.

The gap vector needs to be the point where you believe the outflow point is for 
the watershed. This can be made in QGIS pretty easily.
