This script is for creating rasters based off the inundation metrics that were 
calculated from "calculate_inundation_metrics.R". The added comments go more in 
depth.

The "four_sites" file can be found in "Data_AllSites/Derived Raster/
Inundation Maps from Elevation Models/four_sites.Rds".

The dems are located in "Data_AllSites/Original Raster/UAS LiDAR DTM" and each
site has its own folder with a dtm in it.

"r read metrics" Block:
This block is used for reading in the four_sites file.

"read dem" Block:
Used to read in your chosen dem

"prop time predict raster" Block:
Used to create a prediction raster based on Proportion_Time_Inundated metric that
was calculated from the four_sites file. For this block the metric can be switched
with any of the other calculated metrics from four_sites. This is shown through 
the "med time raster predict" and "depth 95 raster predict" blocks.

"visual plots" Block:
This block is used to show the rasters that you made from the previous blocks.

"write out_tif" Block:
Used to write out the raster you created and put it in a folder of your choosing.
