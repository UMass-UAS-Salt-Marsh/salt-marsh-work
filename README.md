This repository contains my initial exploratory work for the Saltmarsh project.
As code matures I will likely move it into a formal R package.

The structure is as follows:
* `R/`  function code.  Source the `.R` files here to define functions.
*  `hydrology`  Calculate hydrology metrics and perform regression fro 
  for four sites.
* `lidar`  Exploratory lidar data processing for a single site.
